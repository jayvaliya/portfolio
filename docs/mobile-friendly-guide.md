# Mobile-Friendly SEO Optimization Guide

This guide outlines steps to ensure your portfolio website is optimized for mobile devices, which is critical for SEO as Google uses mobile-first indexing.

Your portfolio is built with responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS, which provides a good foundation for mobile-friendliness. However, here are some additional optimizations to consider:

## Optimization Checklist

### 1. Viewport Configuration âœ…
- The viewport meta tag is already set correctly in your layout component.

### 2. Text Readability

- Check line height (1.5 for body text is recommended)
- Maintain sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text)

### 3. Touch Targets
- All interactive elements should be at least 44x44px
- Ensure sufficient spacing between touch targets (at least 8px)
- Check your Navbar and button components on mobile screens

### 4. Performance Optimization
